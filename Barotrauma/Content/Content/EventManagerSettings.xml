    <!-- DefaultEventThreshold
      Event threshold determines how low the intensity of the current situation has to be for a new random event to be created.
      The threshold may increase over time, but is reset to this default value after creating a new event. -->

  <!-- EventThresholdIncrease
      How much the event threshold increases per second. Can be used to make sure that new events will be created
      eventually even if the current crisis situation is not resolved (e.g. sub laying flooded on the ocean floor...)-->

  <!-- EventCooldown
      Minimum amount of time between creating new random events. -->

  <!-- MinEventDifficulty, MaxEventDifficulty
      The created events will be randomly chosen from events whose difficulty is between these values. -->

  <!-- MinLevelDifficulty, MaxLevelDifficulty
      The difficulty of the selected level determines which event manager settings are used. If the difficulty
      of the level matches multiple settings, the setting is selected randomly. -->
